## SET 1- MAKEMORE (PART 1)🔗


Hello. These are my Notes and Codes repo of training my second neural network. This is obviously from the video (Makemore - Part 1) put on this by the main man himself, Andrej Karpathy.   \
\
**You can view my portfolio blog for a detailed description. You can read it [here](https://muzzammil-ai.netlify.app/personal-projects)** \
\
You will find all my notes that I have understood on this in the notes directory. The codes have been broken down into bit-by-bit so that I have a better understanding on them. **I've divided them into 3 sections, so both the notes and the notebooks have the same corresponding names.**

&nbsp;

**✍🏻Notes**
Follow the codes in order if you are revisiting them. Best way is to start from the notes, as the respective notebooks are linked there itself after the explainations. \
There are some useful comments inside the notebooks as well. So make sure you read those as well :)

*See you in the next one!*
